PROJECT DETAILS:
---------------
Project Title: Wi-Fi Packet Sniffer Using ESP32 for Wireless Device Detection and Basic Network Monitoring

WEEKLY OBJECTIVES:
-----------------
1. Learn Wi-Fi frame types: Beacon, Probe Request, Authentication, etc.
2. Set up ESP32 development environment with PlatformIO
3. Load basic Wi-Fi sniffing example and print raw frame metadata over serial

ACTIVITIES COMPLETED:
--------------------
• ✅ Set up PlatformIO development environment for ESP32
• ✅ Created basic WiFi packet sniffer using ESP32 promiscuous mode
• ✅ Implemented frame capture and metadata extraction (channel, MAC, RSSI, frame type)
• ✅ Added frame type classification (Management, Control, Data frames)
• ✅ Implemented channel hopping (switches every 2 seconds through channels 1-13)
• ✅ Added smart filtering to reduce output spam and show only interesting frames
• ✅ Created comprehensive README with usage instructions and legal warnings

TECHNICAL ACHIEVEMENTS:
----------------------
• Successfully captured WiFi management frames (beacons, probe requests/responses)
• Implemented real-time frame analysis with RSSI monitoring
• Added SSID extraction from beacon and probe request frames
• Created statistics tracking (interesting frames vs total frames per channel)
• Developed clean, well-documented code structure

CHALLENGES FACED:
----------------
• Initial output was very noisy with too many frames - solved with smart filtering
• Understanding WiFi frame structure and MAC address positioning
• Managing channel switching timing to capture maximum devices

SOLUTIONS IMPLEMENTED:
---------------------
• Created is_interesting_frame() function to filter out data/control frames
• Added proper frame type and subtype classification
• Implemented channel switching with 2-second intervals for optimal coverage

NEXT WEEK PLAN:
--------------
• Implement device tracking and MAC address registry
• Add signal strength grouping (strong, medium, weak)
• Develop anomaly detection for probe floods and deauth attacks
• Create device activity statistics and reporting

PROJECT METRICS:
---------------
Hours Spent: 15-20 hours
Code Lines Written: ~300 lines of C++ code
Files Created: main.cpp, platformio.ini, README.md

TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:
------------------------
Hardware Used: ESP32 Wrover Dev Board
Software Used: PlatformIO, Arduino Framework, Serial Monitor
Libraries Used: WiFi, esp_wifi, esp_event, esp_log, nvs_flash

DELIVERABLES STATUS:
-------------------
• ✅ Working development setup with PlatformIO
• ✅ Captured frames with channel, MAC, RSSI, frame type over UART
• ✅ Frame filtering and classification system
• ✅ Channel hopping implementation
• ✅ GitHub repository with complete documentation
